					I am a software developer with great emphasis on performance
					and perfection.
				</p>

				<p class="mb-8">
					Recently, I've been working on an IoT sensor platform. We
					are hoping to release it really soon.
				</p>

				<p class="mb-4">
					For the past few years I had made drive throughs even more
					seamless at
					<a target="blank" href="https://www.rolletpay.com">Rollet</a
					>. I was an early bird at the company, so I had the
					opportunity to work on almost everything software related.
				</p>

				<p class="mb-8">
					My best work at
					<a target="blank" href="https://www.rolletpay.com">Rollet</a
					>
					was definitely the IoT system we designed and developed.
				</p>

				<p class="mb-8">
					Previously I was making an HR software system at Ulyssys.
